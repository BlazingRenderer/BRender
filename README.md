# Blazing Renderer (BRender) 1.4.0

This is an updated, modernized fork of [BRender](https://blazingrender.net/),
based on the following source code releases:

- [BRender-1997](https://github.com/foone/BRender-1997)
- [BRender-v1.3.2](https://github.com/foone/BRender-v1.3.2)

There are OpenGL and SDL2 drivers, as well as an x86-specific software rendering
backend used as the reference implementation.

Many sample applications are included, as well as most of the original utilities
released with the engine.

Enjoy!
